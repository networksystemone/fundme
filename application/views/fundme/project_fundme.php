<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
    My full name is Phat Thanh Pham and I'm living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I graduated from <a href="http://www.vanlanguni.edu.vn" target="_blank">Van Lang University</a> with GPA 7.4/10. I studied the Software Engineering program that is transfered from <a href="http://cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, USA. I had worked as a web developer freelancer since I was a third-year student and got a high salary job at a Singapore software company after graduation. But It still can't get enough for the expenses of studying the master program in the US. My parents are at the age of sixty and still earning a living, so I don't want to put anymore financial pressure on them.

<h3>The MSCS Program</h3>
<p>
    My destination is <a href="http://www.mum.edu" target="_blank">Maharishi University of Management</a> (MUM) located in a peaceful city Fairfield, Iowa, USA. The <a href="http://mscs.mum.edu" target="_blank">MSCS</a> program in MUM has attracted many international students every year. It provides a strong foundation in all of the main areas of Computer Science, with an emphasis on applied topics in current technology and software development. Students will spend the first year (eight months) in residence on campus taking full-time coursework. Then they will work in a paid practical intership in a US company and study in distance up to two years to complete the program.

<h3>Application Status</h3>
<p>
    I have passed the technical examination and the English interview via telephone. The next step is verifying finances by sending the official bank statement to school. When I done it the university will be able to issue I-20 form for visa interview.
