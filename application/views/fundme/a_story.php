    It started a long time ago in a country side, middle of Vietnam. My parents were farmers and agriculture is the economic base in there. People were working hard day by day although the land is poor, drought and floods occur every single year. Living in harsh lands makes people so hard and diligence. My parents grew rice, sugarcane and everything to earn a living. Vietnam was a poor country, male-dominated status was so high at this time. Women were treated as the second-class citizens and a son is a precious of a family. My parents are not an exception. They kept finding me while already having five daughters. Because of financial problems, my sisters didn’t finish their school. They must quit their studies and work on the fields to help my family. Three years after giving a birth to my youngest sister, me, their only son was born.

    It was so hard for my parents to see my sisters grew up in a bad environment and didn't got a good education. They didn’t want it happen to me. They wanted to see me grow up in a better environment, study in a good education, and have a bright future. They decided to sell our small house to get a small amount of money and moved all to Ho Chi Minh City – the largest and the best city in Vietnam after one year giving me a birth.

<h3>Achievement</h3>
<p>
    As a child living in a modern city, I was able to go to preschool, studied English from grade three. It's luckier than many children living in the country side can't go to school. I had a chance to approach high technology. I went to university and studied the world-class Software Engineering program that is transferred from <a href="http://cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, USA in Vietnam. Studying in good environment, being taught by industrial experienced lecturers with the best program leveraged me to the highest ability and equiped me well to pursue my IT career.

    Four years hard working in the university, I graduated with a good Bachelor degree and was in the top highest salary of graduated students. After one year working in a Singapore software company, now I am a project leader of a team with seven members developing big projects of my company.

<h3>Shape my Dream</h3>
<p>
    Seeing back to the total progress of my growing up, everything I have today is given by my parents. They didn’t hesitate to move from the country side to the biggest city with empty hands to raise their children till today. I always see that decision as a revolution. It always inspires me in the inside to live better, to work harder and to dream bigger. I have a passion in IT. My dream doesn’t stop at that job. My dream is starting up my own company that provides software products and solutions for Vietnam’s enterprise and Southeast Asia. Now I am twenty-three, the beautiful age with full of vitality and passion. This is time for me to make my own revolution, go to the US - the cradle of every technology fields and study IT.
