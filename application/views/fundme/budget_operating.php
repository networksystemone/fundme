    <b>$12,000</b> includes <b>$10,700</b> in order to make it through the first school year of the program (<a href="http://mscs.mum.edu/financial-aid-intl.html#cploan">Financial Aid</a>):</br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tuition fee (textbooks, dormitory and food on campus included): <b>$6,700</b></li>
    <li>Emergency expenses: <b>$500</b></li>
    <li>Personal expenses: <b>$2,500</b></li>
    <li>Flight ticket: <b>$1,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    And the rest <b>$1,300</b> pays for <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/pricing/" target="_blank">GoFundMe fee</a> (7.9% and $0.3 each donation). That's the measurement result of 1,200 people and $10 each donation.

    Now I'm working extremely hard to pay for another expenses such as application/I-20 courier fee, Visa application fee and buying stuff for a living in the US.
